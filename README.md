# etch-a-sketch

The Etch-a-Sketch consists of a grid of squares that can be filled with color when the user hovers over them with the mouse. The color can be changed using the panel on the left-hand side, where the user can choose between black, grey, and random. The grid size can also be adjusted depending on the input the user enters on the right-hand side.

I learned a lot about the DOM and how it can be utilized to create a grid consisting of several divs. I also implemented event listeners to add the desired functionality to the page.
